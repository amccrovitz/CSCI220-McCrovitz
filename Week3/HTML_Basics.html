        <!--Description of the experiment-->
        <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>
            College students consume surprising quantities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine" target="_blank">caffeine</a> on average. 
            This study seeks to determine if a correlation exists between the amount 
            of caffeine an individual consumes daily and that individual's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education" target="_blank">grade point 
            average</a> in school.
        </p>
        <p>
            The initial experiment included a group, which received daily caffeine equal to the national 
            average (Group A), a group which received twice the national daily average (Group B), 
            and a control group which received a placebo (Group C). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Preliminary results indicate that average consumption of daily caffeine led to a slight
             and steady increase in GPA throughout the term. A higher than average consumption 
             of caffeine led to higher GPA initially, but then grades fell off towards the end of the 
             semester. Finally, no consumption of caffeine led to neither a significant increase or 
             decrease in overall GPA performance.

         <!--Steps of the experiment-->
        <h2>Steps to Reproduce</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>100 students were selected from volunteer applicants between the ages of 18-22 years old, with equal numbers of female and male participants and with a starting GPA between 3.2 and 3.3. </li>
            <li>Each student was assigned a number from 1-100</li>
            <li>Numbers were then randomly selected and assigned to groups A, B, and C</li>
            <li>Group A was given caffeine equivalent to 3 cups of coffee per day (the national average)</li>
            <li>Group B was given caffeine equivalent to 6 cups of coffee per day</li>
            <li>Group C was given a placebo</li>
            <li>Grade point averages were tracked throughout the term and averaged by group at the start of the semester, at midterm, and after final grades were submitted</li>
        </ol>
